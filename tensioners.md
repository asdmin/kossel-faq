When 'the rubber bands are necessary', what really necesseray is to replace the joints (also means replacing the arms).
These tensioner/rubberband constructions will only get 'a bit more time' by sacrificing both the accuracy of the printer and speeding up wear and tear.

Wear and tear: excess force on the joints will increase their wear, this is self evident.

Sacrificing quality: if something is loose enough that it moves/shifts/rattles or otherwise be in a position it is not supposed to be, it will be _anywhere except where it should be_.
One can hook up a couple of rubber bands and force a joint to be at _one_ of the many possible positions it may otherwise be, but it will never be in the _correct one_.
Parallels will no longer be parallels, equal lengths will no longer be equal lengths.

Plus these elastic things hold stuff up to a certain force, and when the force exeeds their limits, they will be more than useless: they will start adding their own artifacts to the printed piece.

I don't say not to use them! But they are spare wheels of a delta printer. On your car you use your spare wheel only as long as you get a proper one. You should also do the same to your printer.
