### Who needs rubber bands on their delta printer arms?

I see many people hooking up rubber bands, sprintgs, printed or other tensioners to their diagonal arms.

This is a problem, because these rubber bands are 

- either completely unnecessary,
- or an incorrect solution for a problem.


#### Unnecessary

If one's printer can print nicely without them, the rubber bands will not add to the print quality.
They will, however generate a constant and unnecessary force on the joint, which will increase their wear.

#### Sacrificing quality: 

If something is loose enough that it moves/shifts/rattles or otherwise be in a position it is not supposed to be, it will be __anywhere except where it should be__.
One can hook up a couple of rubber bands and force a joint to be at __one__ of the many possible positions it may otherwise be, but it will never be in the __correct one__.
Parallels will no longer be parallels, equal lengths will no longer be equal lengths.

On top,  these elastic things hold stuff up to a certain force, and when the force exeeds their limits, they will be more than useless: they will start adding their own artifacts to the printed piece.

### Conclusion

When 'the rubber bands are necessary', what really necesseray is to replace the joints (also means replacing the arms).
These tensioner/rubberband constructions are sacrificing both the accuracy of the printer and speeding up wear and tear.

I don't say not to use them! But they are spare wheels of a delta printer. On your car you use your spare wheel only as long as you get a proper one. You should also do the same to your printer.
